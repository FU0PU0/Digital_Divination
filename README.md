# DigitalDivination
In Taiwan, temples are a common part of daily life. Even those without a specific religious belief often visit temples during significant life moments to pray for peace, success, or for their wishes to come true. This practice is not only a tradition but a deeply rooted part of Taiwanese cultural memory. I believe it reflects a universal human need—for spiritual support and emotional grounding.

With this project, I aim to transform Taiwan’s traditional rituals—such as divination by jiaobei (moon blocks) and drawing fortune slips—into an interactive online experience. My goal is to share this aspect of Taiwanese culture with a wider audience, and perhaps offer some guidance or comfort to those in need.

Users begin by writing down their wish, then perform a digital jiaobei ritual, which yields one of three randomly generated results representing the deity’s response. Afterward, the Advice Slip API provides a short piece of guidance, mimicking the traditional fortune slip. Finally, by entering a general location, users are shown a "lucky place" for the day using features from the Google Maps API, complete with location, distance, and directions.
